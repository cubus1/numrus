# Credits

numrus grew out of a cognitive computing project that needed hardware-accelerated vector operations in pure Rust.

## Inspirations (zero code reused, all built from scratch)

- James Lee Stakelum — "34 Next-Gen LLM Tactics" (cognitive patterns → SIMD ops)
- OpenNARS — Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (belief revision model)
- CLAM — Cover-tree Like Approximate Method (exact metric search)
- kuzu, lancedb, falcorndb — columnar graph architecture ideas
- ladybug-rs — XOR delta layer pattern (concurrent vector operations)
